Steps to build the prototype arm-


Glue an ice cream spoon to the tip of a potentiometer along its length.  
Now glue that potentiometer to the wooden piece E (25cm x 25cm) . 
This would serve as the controller of the base of the robotic arm.
At the bottom of that ice cream spoon fix the base of another potentiometer.
Stick an ice cream spoon at the tip of that potentiometer. 
This would act as the controller of jaw of the robotic arm. 
Now glue a potentiometer at the top of the ice cream spoon and insert another spoon to the tip of the potentiometer.
Glue the base of a potentiometer to that spoon.
Insert another stick at the tip of the potentiometer.  
This would be the prototype arm which will act as the controller for our robotic arm.
