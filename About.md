# robotic-arm
An Arduino project which basically is a robotic arm which can be controlled very easily,with other features like learning actions.
The main feauture is its learing ability.A robotic controller arm is also provided with which you can control the main arm.
The robotic arm shadows all the actions that we do on the controller.Part from this the best feauture is the pus button.
Each time you push the button,the present postion of all the servos will be recorded.Youcan record many numer of actions
and on double pushing the button the robotic arm will trace all the saved postion thus performing an action.By this way you 
can make your robo learn!!!!!
Happy hacking!!
